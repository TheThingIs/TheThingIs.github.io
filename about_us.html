					<h1>TheThingIs</h1>

					<h2>info</h2>
					<p>
					I am an 18 year old hobby artist and streamer. I also have a strong love for sandbox games such as minecraft and terraria. Currently I live in Sweden and studying engineering in a swedish school. According to the swedish grade system I am in 2nd grade for the 2nd time. I you are confused, it is ok, the system is weird. Anyhow, I am also a furry evento I do not want to admit it. So most of the art you will see me draw is furry art. However, I also draw a lot of growtopians which basically is players from the game growtopia. The game itself is garbage but the different sets that you can make in the game is really fun to draw. Altho, the fishnets stockings are horrible. Other things you should know about me is that I am an introvert and therefore avoids interacting with people as much as possible. So, I prefer to remain silent in conversations.

								<h3>Info</h3>
								<p>Thing is my first fursona I ever created and remains my main to this day. You have seen him all around this website because I use him as an avatar. Thing I currently a dutch angel dragon but this might change in the future as he have a few 	features that might not fit a dutchie</p>
								<br>
								<h3>Lore</h3>
								<p>The lore isnt 100% done yet but I can tell you about a few things. So Thing made a deal with a demon in order to have power and this is why he have a mark on his chest. The power made him enable to summon weapons depending on his needs and somewhat change his from. You can read more about the different forms he can take below. However, Thing regrets this deal and that is why you can see him crying sometimes. It is also easy for him to lose control while he uses his 	powers.</p>

						<h3>Modes</h3>
						<div>
							<div id="thingmode">
								<h3>Speed Mode</h3>
								<p>In speedmode thing is enable to summon a bow andsome armor and huge wings that makes it possible for him to fly proporly. There is a secound phase to his form where his arms burst into 3 pairs. This requies a lot of energy and is therefore only seen in thought battles or situations. </p>
								<h3>Power Mode</h3>
								<p>In power mode thing uses red energy to summon a pair of gauntlets and some armor. Just like speed mode his arms can burst into 3 pairs and thereby thing can wield 3 pairs of gauntlets at once</p>

Cell 2: "Suuuuuh!"</p>
